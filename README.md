# A Comparative Analysis of A* and Jump Point Search Across Varying Obstacle Densities and Map Topologies On Uniform-Cost Grid Maps

This project contains a C++ program that runs experiments comparing A* and Jump Point Search on 512x512 grid maps. The algorithms are executed both on pre-made maps and randomly scattered maps, measuring execution time and expanded nodes for both algorithms. Results are exported in CSV format and PPM format for visualization.

Pre-made maps are taken from https://digitalcommons.du.edu/gridmaps2D/
